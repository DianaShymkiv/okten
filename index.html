<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<hr>

<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born on 15 April 1990 in Paris, to English lawyers Chris Watson and Jacqueline Luesby.[3][7][8] Watson lived in Maisons-Laffitte near Paris until age five. Her parents divorced when she was young, and Watson moved to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire while spending weekends at her father's house in London.[3][9] Watson has said she speaks some French, though "not as well" as she used to.[10] After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, she attended the Dragon School, remaining there until 2003.[3] From age six, she wanted to become an actress,[11] and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting.[12]</p>
</div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>By age ten, Watson had performed in Stagecoach productions and school plays including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[13] but she had never acted professionally prior to the Harry Potter series. After the Dragon School, Watson moved on to Headington School, Oxford.[3] While on film sets, she and her castmates were tutored for up to five hours a day.[14] In June 2006, she took GCSE school examinations in ten subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades. In May 2007, she took AS levels in English, Geography, Art, and History of Art. The following year, she dropped History of Art to pursue the three A levels, receiving an A grade in each subject.[3][15][16]</p>
</div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>Watson took a gap year after finishing secondary school,[17] to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009,[18] but asserted that she intended to continue her studies[19] and later confirmed she had chosen Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.[20] In March 2011, after 18 months at the university, Watson announced she was deferring her course for "a semester or two",[21] though she attended Worcester College, Oxford during the 2011–12 academic year as part of the Visiting Student Programme.[22][23]</p>
</div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>In a 2014 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Watson said just before graduation that it took five years to finish her degree instead of four because, owing to her acting work, she "ended up taking two full semesters off".[24] On 25 May, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[25] In 2013, she had become certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents are not allowed to speak, in order "to figure out how to be at home with myself".[26][27] Regarding her meditation training, she stated in an interview with Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding "a way to always feel safe and at home within myself. Because I can never rely on a physical place."[28]</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<h3><b>1999–2003: Beginnings and breakthrough</b></h3>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the film adaptation of British author J. K.
    Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were
    impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel
    Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast in the roles of the school friends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter
    and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen
    test.[11]</p></div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film
    broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.[29][30]
    Critics singled out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance "admirable",[31] and
    IGN said she "stole the show".[32] Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone,
    winning the Young Artist Award for Lead
    ing Young Actress.[33]</p></div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box"><p>A year later, Watson reprised her role as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her co-stars had matured between films,[34] while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for "under-employing" Watson's hugely popular character.[35] Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.[36]</p></div>
