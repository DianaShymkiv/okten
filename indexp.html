   <h1>IVAN PULUJ</h1>
</div>

<div class="title"><h4/>The famous Ukrainian physicist and inventor</h4></div>
<div class="title2"><h2> Biography</h2></div>
<p>Ivan Pului graduated with honors from Theological Faculty of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna">University of Vienna</a> (1869), later also from the Department of Philosophy (1872). In 1876 Pulyui finished his doctorate on internal friction in gases at the University of Strasbourg under supervision of August Kundt. Pului taught at the Navy academy in Fiume (Rijeka, Croatia) (1874–1876), University of Vienna (1874–1884) and the German part of the Higher Technical School in Prague (1884–1916). He served as the rector of the Higher Technical School in Prague (German part) in 1888–1889. Puluj also worked as a state adviser on electrical engineering for Bohemian and Moravian local governments. In addition he completed a translation of the Bible into the Ukrainian language.</p>

<div class="title2"><h2>Scientific contribution</h2></div>
<div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #541d1d"><p>Puluj did heavy research into cathode rays, publishing several papers about those rays between 1880 and 1882. In
    1881 as a result of experiments into what he called cold light Prof. Puluj developed the Puluj lamp. Puluj
    experimented with his new device and published his results in a scientific paper, Luminous Electrical Matter and the
    Fourth State of Matter in the Notes of the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences (1880–1883), but expressed his
    ideas in an obscure manner using obsolete terminology. Puluj did gain some recognition when the work was translated
    and published as a book by the Royal Society in the UK.

    While Puluj's finding were essentially X-rays, he reported his results after Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen published his,
    and can not be credited with the discovery of X-rays.

    Puluj made many other discoveries as well. He is particularly noted[citation needed] for inventing a device for
    determining the mechanical equivalent of heat that was
    exhibited at the Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1878. Puluj also participated in opening of several power plants in
    Austria-Hungary.</p></div>
